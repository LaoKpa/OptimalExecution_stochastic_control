# OptimalExecution_stochastic_control

This is for the capstone project "Optimal Execution of a VWAP order". 

In this project, I implemented the stochastic control approach to solve the optimization problem of optimal execution privided by Frei[2015]. This is an example of how the stochastic control approach can be used in real-world stock tick data.

In this repository, I will show how to calibrate model parameters, simulate the gamma bridge, as well as build the shareholding trajectory.
